## Manufacturers

## Create a manufacturer

Admins and super admins have the possibility to create new ones in the admin area: **Manufacturer** - Create new manufacturer

So that the manufacturer can log in, log out of the admin, then under "Login" and "Forgot password" for the manufacturer request a new password, in the box enter the e-mail address of the manufacturer and click "Send". The manufacturer then gets the password sent to his address.

## Manufacturer Settings

In the manufacturer overview there is a symbol with a gear on the far right - here the following settings for the manufacturers can be changed. Since version 1.4, the manufacturers themselves can change their settings, they can find this under the menu item "Settings" in the manufacturer login.


### Visibility of the products

**Active**

Only admins and super admins can activate or deactivate the manufacturer. The manufacturer himself can not do this.

**Delivery break**

The delivery break can be specified as a period. The products are automatically deactivated and reactivated, and the manufacturer also displays the period of the delivery break.

**Important**: Manufacturers must specify in which period **may not be** ordered. Example: If delivery is not possible on Friday, 18.11.2017, the period must be 08.11.2017 (Wednesday) to 14.11.2017 (Tuesday). This is the period in which orders for Friday 18.11.2017 will be collected.

Both fields empty means: delivery break is **not active**.


**Just for members?**

If activated, only registered members can see this manufacturer.


### notifications
Many automated email notifications can be enabled or disabled individually for each vendor to help curb the flood of emails as much as possible.
A notification email is also sent to the manufacturer for instant orders. This can also be disabled.


### Other settings

**Variable membership fee**

This point can only be seen if the module is activated. Manufacturers will be deducted the registered percentage from the invoice, that is, the prices must be accordingly higher in the system.

**Which amount must be transferred?** In the list of ordered products grouped by manufacturer, an additional column with the (possibly) reduced amount is displayed next to the actual invoice amount. For a better overview this is red if the amount is different (ie a percentage is defined).

**Important:** The amount shown in the list is always calculated according to the currently entered percentage. If this is changed and the list is called afterwards, the amounts change! Only in the bills (PDF), the actual amount is stored and viewed in retrospect.

This setting can not be viewed or changed by the manufacturer.

**Preset tax rate for new products**

If z. For example, if a manufacturer is not subject to VAT, his or her default tax rate can be changed to 0%. All newly created products have then automatically set 0%. This reduces the potential for error and work for the manufacturer.

**Contact person**

Every manufacturer can be assigned a contact person. The manufacturer then has access to the name, e-mail address and telephone number of this member.

This setting can not be changed by the manufacturer.
