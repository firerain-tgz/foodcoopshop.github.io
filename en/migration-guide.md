## Migration guide

**Please remember to always make a database and file backup before updating your FoodCoopShop installation!**

* There is no automatic update tool, updating FoodCoopShop needs to be done manually. 
* **Be aware**: updating from v1.x to v2.x can only be done from v1.5.
* If you want to update from v1.3 to v1.5 directly (skipping v1.4), you can do that. Just follow the instructions for updating to v1.4 and v1.5. 


### FCS v2.0.x to FCS v2.1.x
* replace source code => see bottom of page
* execute migrations => see bottom of page
* if you have problems with the update, contact me: office@foodcoopshop.com (Mario)


### FCS v1.5.x to FCS v2.0.x
* FCS v2.0 uses CakePHP3 which is **mostly incompatible** to CakePHP2
* **therefore you can only update to v2.0 from v1.5!**, so if you are working on v1.x and you want to update to v2.0, first update to 1.5!
* you can download v1.5 [here](https://www.foodcoopshop.com/wp-content/uploads/releases/FoodCoopShop-v1.5.0.zip)
* replace source code => see bottom of page
* use the new structure of config files (rename custom.config.php to custom_config.php), follow the steps in the updated [Installation details]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/installation-details)
* be aware that the content of the config file changed in syntax! renaming the file to custom_config.php **is not enough!**
* add the following code to the top of your /webroot/.htaccess in order to redirect some urls from v1.x

```

* execute ``$ bin/cake migrations migrate`` to execute database migrations. If you do not have shell access, you need to update the migrations manually. The files with the sql statements are located in the folder /config/Migrations).

### replacing source code
* rename old installation folder (e.g. foodcoopshop-old)
* upload source code of new version into new folder with the name of the old version before renaming
* copy the following files and folders from your old installation directory into the new directory
    * config/custom_config.php
    * config/credentials.php
    * webroot/files
    * files_private
    * and any other adapted files (favicon, logo, images,...)
